Here’s a structured **5-day Week 2 program** following your objectives. It progresses safely, reinforces movement patterns, and ends with **controlled “live” activities** appropriate for new white belts.

---

# **Week 2 – Rolls & Safety (5-Day Program)**

**Theme:** Safe falling, regaining base, handling scrambles
**Core Movements:** Forward roll, backward roll, sit-through, sprawl
**Technical Focus:** Base recovery and safe reactions after a takedown
**Live Day:** Very limited sparring based only on the movements learned so far

---

# **🟦 Day 1 — Forward Roll & Falling Safety**

### **Warm-up Movements**

* Forward rolls (low squat → shoulder line) – 10 reps
* Shrimp & reverse shrimp – 2× across the mat
* Technical stand-up – 10 reps each side

### **Technical Portion**

* How to fall safely (tuck chin, slap breakfall softly, curved spine)
* Forward roll from kneeling → standing base

### **Drills**

* Partner-assisted forward roll + base recovery (slow)
* Forward roll → technical stand-up link drill

### **Goal**

* Student can roll over the correct shoulder and recover base without exposing the back.

---

# **🟦 Day 2 — Backward Roll & Base Regain from Seated**

### **Warm-up Movements**

* Backward rolls (from seated) – 10 reps
* Hip heist / sit-through – 20 reps alternating
* Sprawl footwork – 10 slow reps

### **Technical Portion**

* Backward roll to seated guard
* Base regain: seated guard → technical stand-up → square stance

### **Drills**

* Partner push-back: partner gently pushes → backward roll → base
* Seated guard pummel → stand-up drill

### **Goal**

* Student can safely backward roll, protect the neck, and regain stance.

---

# **🟦 Day 3 — Sit-Through, Sprawl & Scramble Safety**

### **Warm-up Movements**

* Sit-through variations (hip escape sit-out, windshield sit-through) – 20 reps
* Sprawl → re-pummel entry – 10 reps

### **Technical Portion**

* Hip heist to regain guard after a scramble
* Sprawl to prevent basic takedown and immediately rebuild base

### **Drills**

* Sprawl → sit-through → back to stance loop
* Partner level-change fake → student sprawls & circles

### **Goal**

* Student builds reflexes for basic takedown defense and safe scrambles.

---

# **🟦 Day 4 — Movement Integration & Reaction Chains**

### **Warm-up Movements**

* Forward roll → backward roll chains – 6 cycles
* Sprawl → sit-out → stand-up – 10 cycles

### **Technical Portion**

* Reacting after being knocked over:
  **fall safely → backward roll → sit-through → base**
* “Takedown recovery sequence”

### **Drills**

* Coach calls out movements: roll, sprawl, sit-through, stand-up
* Controlled scramble drill: partner gives 30–40% pressure

### **Goal**

* Ability to link movements under light pressure with correct posture and frames.

---

# **🟦 Day 5 — Controlled Live Day (Safe & Limited Objectives)**

**No submissions. No top pressure. No passing battles beyond what’s taught.**
**All rounds 1–2 minutes with clear mission-based goals.**

### **Warm-up Movements (quick)**

* Forward roll, backward roll, sprawl, sit-through – 2× each

---

## **1) Positional Mini-Rounds — “Regain Base Only”**

**Start Positions**

* Partner lightly pushes student backward
* Student must fall safely → roll → regain base
  **Constraints:**
* Partner gives only realistic resistance (20–30%)

---

## **2) Takedown Reaction Rounds**

**Partner level-changes or lightly pulls — student sprawls**
Add sit-through or base regain depending on angle.
No actual takedowns yet — only reactions.

---

## **3) Controlled Scramble Games**

### **Game A — Turtle Escape**

* Student starts in turtle
* Partner places only hands (no hooks)
* Goal: sit-through → guard
* Time: 60–90 sec

### **Game B — Seated Guard Recovery**

* Student seated, partner tries to push/pull lightly
* Goal: roll or technical stand-up to recover base

---

## **4) Final Round — “Movement-Only Sparring”**

**No grips, no submissions, no pins.**
Students may only use:

* Forward roll
* Backward roll
* Sit-through
* Sprawl
* Technical stand-up
* Guard recovery via hip movement

**Goal:** stay safe, maintain balance, and regain base whenever compromised.

---

# **Summary Goals for Week 2**

By the end of Week 2, your white belts should:

✓ Fall safely and protect the neck & spine
✓ Perform forward/backward rolls cleanly
✓ Sprawl properly and keep base
✓ Use sit-outs to escape light pressure
✓ Regain stance or guard during scrambles
✓ Handle limited “live” situations safely
