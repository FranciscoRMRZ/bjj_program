Here’s a **4-day weekly exercise plan** for *shrimp, inverted shrimp, and bridging* that fits perfectly into the 24-week curriculum.
Each day emphasizes *one movement as the primary*, while still drilling the others for retention.
All drills scale from easy → harder → functional.

---

# 🥋 **4-Day Weekly Movement Plan**

*Each class: ~10 minutes of movement work before technique.*

---

# **📅 Day 1 – Standard Shrimp (Primary Focus)**

### **1. Warm-Up Drills**

* **Straight-Line Shrimp:**
  2 laps down and back
* **Side-to-Side Shrimp:**
  Shrimp right → reset → shrimp left (10 each side)

### **2. Technical Drills**

* **Shrimp to Guard Recovery Wall Drill:**
  Feet against wall, push off → hip escape to recover guard (20 reps)
* **Partner Frame + Shrimp Escape Drill:**
  Partner applies light chest pressure
  → frame → hip escape → knee insert (10 reps each side)

### **3. Applied Movement Drill**

* **Knee-on-Belly Escape (Shrimp Entry):**
  Partner floats knee on belly → you frame and shrimp
  (1–2 minutes each)

### **Goal of the Day:**

**Build clean hip escape mechanics and connect them to guard recovery.**

---

# **📅 Day 2 – Inverted Shrimp (Primary Focus)**

*(Helps with guard retention, back exposure defense, and side control escapes)*

### **1. Warm-Up Drills**

* **Inverted Shrimp Across Mat:**
  Roll onto shoulder → push hip out → recover legs (10 per side)
* **Granby Entry (Beginner-Friendly):**
  Mini shoulder rolls with hip extension (10 reps)

### **2. Technical Drills**

* **Inward Hip Recovery Drill:**
  Partner stands lightly over your legs → you “invert shrimp” under to re-square hips (10–15 reps)
* **Back Exposure Prevention Drill:**
  Partner tries to move around your guard → you invert-shrimp to face them again (timed: 1 minute each)

### **3. Applied Movement Drill**

* **Side Control Reverse Shrimp Escape:**
  Start bottom side → frame → inward shrimp toward your partner’s legs → recover guard

### **Goal of the Day:**

**Develop frames + inward hip rotation to protect your back and retain guard.**

---

# **📅 Day 3 – Bridge (Primary Focus)**

*(Base for mount escapes, explosive reversals, and guard hip extension)*

### **1. Warm-Up Drills**

* **Bridge to Shoulder:**
  Bridge high → touch opposite shoulder (10 each side)
* **Bridge + Hip Shift:**
  Bridge → shift hips sideways (10 each side)

### **2. Technical Drills**

* **Upa Mechanics (No Partner):**
  Trap arm → trap foot → bridge diagonally (10 reps each side)
* **Partner Upa Escape Reps:**
  Partner mounts lightly
  → execute clean bridge & roll mechanics
  (10 reps each side)

### **3. Applied Movement Drill**

* **Bridge → Shrimp Combination:**
  Bridge explosively → shrimp out the side → recover half or full guard
  (2 minutes each)

### **Goal of the Day:**

**Use bridge to create space or reversals, not just height.**

---

# **📅 Day 4 – Integration Day (Shrimp + Inverted + Bridge)**

This day ties the three core movements together into *functional sequences*.

### **1. Warm-Up Flow**

Continuous cycle for 3–5 minutes:

1. **Bridge**
2. **Shrimp**
3. **Inverted Shrimp**
4. **Technical Stand-Up**

### **2. Technical Integration Drills**

* **Escape Loop Drill:**
  Partner rotates positions every 15 seconds:

  * Side control → shrimp escape
  * Mount → bridge escape
  * North-south → inverted shrimp
    Run 3 cycles.

* **Guard Recovery Gauntlet (Light Resistance):**
  Partner tries to pass guard slowly → you use shrimp + invert combos
  (1 minute each round)

### **3. Applied Movement Drill**

* **Movement-Only Rolling (No Submissions):**
  2–3 minutes focusing on:

  * Hip movement
  * Frames
  * Guard retention
  * Escapes at 30–40% intensity

### **Goal of the Day:**

**Integrate all movements fluidly in live reactions.**

If you want, I can turn this into:
📌 *A printed weekly sheet*,
📌 *A coach-style checklist*,
📌 *A 10-minute daily solo version*, or
📌 *A mat-side "quick reference" card*.

Just tell me which format you prefer!


Here are **4 class-day recommendations** *specifically built around your notes*:

> **Movements:** Shrimp, Bridge, Technical Stand-Up
> **Drills:** Shrimp → Bridge → Technical Stand-Up circuit
> **Concept:** Keep frames at all times
> **Goal:** Recover guard from mount using shrimp + bridge

The structure below takes these same elements and spreads them across four training days so the white belt gets *deep reps + functional integration*.

# 🥋 **4-Day Movement Training Plan (Based on Your Notes)**

---

## **📅 Day 1 — Shrimp (Primary Focus)**

**Purpose:** Build clean hip-escape mechanics for guard recovery.

### **1. Movement Warm-Up**

* Shrimp down the mat (2 laps)
* Reverse Shrimp (1 lap)
* Technical Stand-Up (10 reps)

### **2. Focused Drill**

* **Shrimp → Bridge → Technical Stand-Up** (circuit x 3 rounds)

### **3. Partner Drill**

* Partner applies light mount pressure
  → frame at the hips & throat line
  → **shrimp to knee-in → recover guard**

**Concept Emphasis:**
🔹 Keep your frames intact before you move your hips.

**End Goal:**
Recover guard at least twice from controlled mount.

---

## **📅 Day 2 — Bridge (Primary Focus)**

**Purpose:** Explosive power and angle-changing for escapes.

### **1. Movement Warm-Up**

* High Bridge (10 reps)
* Bridge to Shoulder (10 each side)
* Technical Stand-Up (8 reps)

### **2. Focused Drill**

* **Shrimp → Bridge → Technical Stand-Up** (circuit, slow + perfect form)

### **3. Partner Drill**

* Upa mechanics with partner in low mount:
  Trap arm → trap foot → **bridge diagonally** → move to half guard → reset.

**Concept Emphasis:**
🔹 Frames protect the neck/torso *while* the bridge breaks their balance.

**End Goal:**
Bridge correctly without pushing with arms.

---

## **📅 Day 3 — Technical Stand-Up (Primary Focus)**

**Purpose:** Reinforce base, distance management, scrambles.

### **1. Movement Warm-Up**

* Technical Stand-Up (10 reps)
* Shrimp to technical stand-up (5 each side)
* Bridge to stand-up (light, 5 reps)

### **2. Focused Drill**

* **Shrimp → Bridge → Technical Stand-Up**
  but add *pressure*: partner steps toward you as you stand up.

### **3. Partner Drill**

* From seated guard, partner tries to close distance
  → use frames + technical stand-up to reset space
  → reconnect to guard

**Concept Emphasis:**
🔹 Frames create space, stand-up preserves it.

**End Goal:**
Stand up safely under pressure without turning your back.

---

## **📅 Day 4 — Integration Day (All Movements Combined)**

**Purpose:** Apply shrimp + bridge + T.S.U. to real positional escape scenarios.

### **1. Movement Warm-Up**

Continuous flow (3–4 minutes):
**Shrimp → Bridge → Technical Stand-Up → Repeat**

### **2. Functional Escape Drills**

* **Mount Escape Loop:**
  Partner rotates between:

  * Low mount → you bridge
  * High mount → you shrimp
  * Partner steps back → technical stand-up to reset

Repeat for 3 rounds.

### **3. Guard Recovery Drill**

* Partner mounts with light-to-medium pressure
* Your job:

  * Frame
  * Bridge for space
  * Shrimp for angle
    → **Insert knee and recover guard**

**Concept Emphasis:**
🔹 "Frames first, hips second."
🔹 Use bridge to create space, shrimp to use the space.

### **End Goal:**

Recover guard consistently against controlled but resisting partner.

📅 Day 5 — Live Activities Day (No Full Sparring)

Purpose: Build timing, reactions, and intuitive escapes without rolling hard.
These are live but constrained games that use problem-solving instead of combat.

1. Positional Reaction Games (5–6 rounds, 1 min each)
a) Mount Escape Game

Partner mounts with 60–70% realism

Bottom uses shrimp + bridge only

Top only stabilizes, no submissions
Goal: escape to guard without strength.

b) Guard Recovery Chase

Top tries to pass slowly

Bottom uses frames, shrimp, reverse-shrimp
Goal: keep hips facing the passer.

2. Stand-Up Reaction Game

Starting seated

Partner tries to close distance lightly

You must technical stand-up with clean frames

No takedowns, just pressure + reaction

3. Direction Calling Drill (Coach or Partner)

Coach/partner yells:

“Bridge!”

“Shrimp!”

“Invert!”

“Stand-Up!”
Each command means immediate movement from wherever you are.

This builds automatic responses — essential at white/blue belt.

4. Low-Intensity Movement-Only Rolling (30–40% effort)

Rules:

No submissions

No strength

Only frames, hip movement, base changes, guard recovery

Reset on dominant positions

This is the closest thing to sparring without the chaos.

5. Win Conditions for Day 5

Stay calm under pressure

Use movements instinctively

Recover guard without panic

Maintain frames even when tired
