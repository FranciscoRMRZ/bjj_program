Perfect — here’s a **structured, minimal-yet-solid BJJ white belt curriculum** that builds a lasting foundation toward blue belt.

We’ll separate it into **three modules**:
1️⃣ **Body Movements (Intro Course)**
2️⃣ **Core Ground Techniques**
3️⃣ **Basic Standing Entries and Throws**

---

## 🥋 1️⃣ Body Movements (Intro Course)

These are your *alphabet* of Jiu-Jitsu — every technique relies on these movements.

### **A. Core Hip & Spine Movements**

* **Shrimp (Hip Escape):** Moving hips backward while keeping frame with arms. Used for escaping side control and mount.
* **Reverse Shrimp (Inward Shrimp):** Move hips inward to recover guard.
* **Bridge (Upa):** Used to bump opponent off or create space for escapes.
* **Technical Stand-Up:** Safe way to return to standing from seated guard.
* **Hip Switch (Sit-Through):** Used for transitioning between base positions (e.g., turtle to side control).
* **Granby Roll (Basic Shoulder Roll):** Used for inverting or escaping front headlock.
* **Forward Roll / Backward Roll:** Safety skill for throws and transitions.
* **Backstep:** Used in passing guard and switching sides during control.
* **Sprawl:** Defense against takedowns.
* **Turtle Position & Base Maintenance:** Learn to stay balanced on all fours.

> 🔁 **Drill Routine Example (warm-up loop)**
> Shrimp → Reverse Shrimp → Bridge → Technical Stand-Up → Forward Roll → Backward Roll → Sprawl → Sit-Through (repeat 3x)

Would you like me to extend this into a **6-month structured progression** (e.g., Week 1–24 drills and focus areas)? It would break down this list into manageable training blocks that build up to blue belt-level competency.
