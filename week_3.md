Here’s a complete **Week 3 – Guard & Mount Orientation** program, formatted exactly like Weeks 1 and 2, with 5 days including a controlled live day.
This week is about **positional literacy and survival**, not submissions or passing.

---

# **Week 3 – Guard & Mount Orientation (5-Day Program)**

**Concepts:** Top vs bottom roles • Frames vs pressure • Survival principles
**Drills:** Guard → Mount → Side → Back → Escape → Guard positional loop
**Goal:** Students can *identify major positions*, know whether they are winning/losing, and apply the basic objective: **survive → escape → control → submit** (in that order as white belts).

---

# **🟦 Day 1 — Understanding Guard (Bottom)**

### **Warm-Up Movements**

* Shrimp (hip escape) – 2× mat
* Bridging with frame insert – 20 reps
* Technical stand-up – 10 each side

### **Technical Portion**

* What is *guard*? Closed vs open, what it accomplishes
* Bottom goals: frames, distance management, don’t get flattened
* Basic guard retention:

  * Knee shield frame
  * Hip escape to re-center
  * Getting guard back when pushed down

### **Drills**

* Partner push-pull from inside guard → bottom uses frames, hip escape
* Guard recovery line drill (partner passes lightly → student shrimps back to guard)

### **Goal**

* Students know what “being in guard bottom” means and how to maintain frames.

---

# **🟦 Day 2 — Understanding Side Control (Bottom)**

### **Warm-Up Movements**

* Reverse shrimp – 2× mat
* Hip bridge to elbow frame → hip escape – 15 reps
* Sit-out → guard entry – 10 reps

### **Technical Portion**

* Bottom goals in side control:

  1. Don’t let your near arm get isolated
  2. Insert frames (forearm on neck/hip)
  3. Shrimp to recover guard or turtle safely
* Understanding pressure and weight distribution

### **Drills**

* Partner mounts side control (no submissions) → bottom: frame + hip escape
* Bottom escapes to guard or turtle (choose one escape focus)

### **Goal**

* Student understands “losing” position and the survival → escape process.

---

# **🟦 Day 3 — Mount Orientation (Bottom + Top)**

### **Warm-Up Movements**

* Bridge + trap (bridge high, angle) – 15 reps
* Knee-elbow escape pattern – 15 reps
* Technical stand-up – 10 reps

### **Technical Portion**

**Bottom:**

* Surviving mount (hands tight, elbows in, no pushing straight up)
* Two escapes:

  1. **Bridge & roll** (trap arm + trap foot)
  2. **Knee-elbow escape** (get knee inside → re-guard)

**Top:**

* Staying heavy, grapevines, hands on mat vs hugging the head
* Mount hierarchy (low mount → high mount → S-mount conceptually)

### **Drills**

* Escape chains: bottom alternates bridge escape → knee-elbow escape
* Top holds at 10–20% pressure while bottom practices survival posture

### **Goal**

* Students learn the purpose of mount and how to escape under control.

---

# **🟦 Day 4 — Back Control Orientation + Positional Flow**

### **Warm-Up Movements**

* Granby-like shoulder roll (light, basic) – 10 reps
* Hip heist from turtle – 10 reps
* Sprawl → guard recovery – 10 reps

### **Technical Portion**

* Understanding the **back**: most dominant position
* Basic survival on bottom (protect neck, slide shoulders to the mat)
* Top: seatbelt grip basics and maintaining hooks (no submissions yet)

### **Drills**

* Positional Flow Drill (slow):
  **Guard → Mount → Side → Back → Escape → Guard**
* Students switch roles and go through the loop several times
* Add light resistance at instructor’s call

### **Goal**

* Recognize major dominant positions and where they fit in the “hierarchy.”

---

# **🟦 Day 5 — Controlled Positional Sparring (Position-Only Live Day)**

**Very restricted live rounds** appropriate for beginners.

### **Warm-Up Movements (quick refresher)**

* Shrimp → Bridge → Technical stand-up – 2 cycles
* Knee-elbow escape → recover guard – 10 reps
* Side-control frame → hip escape – 10 reps

---

## **1) Positional Identification Game (Coach-Directed)**

Coach calls a position:

* “Mount bottom!”
* “Side top!”
* “Back bottom!”

Students quickly get into the correct structure and role.
Goal: reinforce position literacy.

---

## **2) “Survive & Escape” Rounds**

Set a timer for 60–90 seconds.
Partner begins on:

* Mount
* Side control
* Back control (light seatbelt, no hooks if students struggle)

**Bottom goal:** survive, build frames, and escape to guard.
**Top goal:** maintain position (NO submissions).

---

## **3) Guard Maintenance Rounds**

Partners start in closed or knee-shield guard.

* Bottom: maintain guard
* Top: only try to posture and open the guard (no passing)

Switch every round.

---

## **4) Positional Flow Live**

**2-minute rounds:**
Students flow through positions without submissions.
Only transitions, escapes, and retention allowed.

---

## **5) Graduation Game — “King of the Escape”**

* One student on bottom side control or mount
* Must escape to regain guard
* Winner stays bottom, rotating partners every round (pure learning focus)

---

# **End-of-Week 3 Outcomes**

By the end of Week 3, white belts should be able to:

✓ Identify guard, side control, mount, back, turtle
✓ Know whether they are “winning” or “losing” positionally
✓ Use frames vs pressure correctly
✓ Survive bottom positions without panic
✓ Perform basic escapes (hip escape, knee-elbow, bridge & roll)
✓ Understand the positional hierarchy: **Back → Mount → Side → Guard → Half → Turtle → Stand-up**
✓ Flow lightly between major positions with control

If you want, I can build **Week 4 – First Escapes & Guard Retention**, or **Weeks 4–12** as a full white-belt beginner curriculum.
